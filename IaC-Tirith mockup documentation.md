Reference document for UI/UX design, based on mockups and final product. This design was inspired form the sub-culture of Cyberpunk, draws form the "cyberpunk-genre" of science fiction, blending High-tech, low-life philosophy with aesthetics for punk-rock and a fascination with technology. In this particular case we use an aggressive and canon breaking concept, inspired form Cyberpunk 2077 and reworked to give our vision and personal improvement. 
The hard and violent contrast of colours and the total and immediate breaking of design canons were the common starting point of our project, the commons sense associate with the red color (e.g., low battery, malfunctioning communication, danger, etc.) was the first element of interest to realize a web-app, to make it clear it is a tool for expert when the situation needs to be controlled and managed. The second colour dominant is Cyan, to create an effect of flickering, like the old monitor form the 90's. 
All the design focus it purpose to give the feedback of using a powerful tool made for dangerous situation and give a retro-feelings, something you can expect to see on board of the Nostromo or a product form the Tyrell Corporation to help bladerunners in their interrogation
